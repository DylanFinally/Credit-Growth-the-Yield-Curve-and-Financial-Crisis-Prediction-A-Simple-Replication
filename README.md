# Credit-Growth-the-Yield-Curve-and-Financial-Crisis-Prediction-A-Simple-Replication
This outlines simple codes to replicate portions of the paper by Kristina Bluwstein, Marcus Buckmann, Andreas Joseph, Sujit Kapadia, and Özgür Şimşek (2021) for someone learning how to program using python.

A huge thank you to the authors for creating such a compelling work and making the codes available for others to experiment with and learn from their massive undertaking. The objective of Bluwstein, Buckmann, Joseph, Kapadia, and Şimşek (2021) is to predict financial crises using Machine Learning Algorithms.

Before this, I had not worked with python. This work is strictly a simple replication attempt to practice coding with random forests and experimental trees and could offer fellow newcomers useful information through which to learn python.
